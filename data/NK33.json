Aerojet acquired several NK-33 engines in the 1990s and refurbished them as AJ26-62 engines for Orbital Science's Antares launch vehicle. Modifications made by Aerojet included increasing rated thrust and equipping the engines to support gimballing. Diameter: [1.83 m]. Plume configured by RealPlume.",
